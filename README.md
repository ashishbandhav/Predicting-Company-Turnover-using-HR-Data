# Study on Predicting Employee Turnover Using HR Data

### 📘 Overview
This repository contains the full implementation, research paper, and experiment code for the project **"Study on Predicting Employee Turnover Using HR Data"** developed by **B. Sai Ashish**.  
The project explores how **Machine Learning algorithms** such as **Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** can predict **employee attrition** using real-world HR datasets.

### 🎯 Objective
Employee turnover is a critical challenge for organizations, leading to significant costs in recruitment, training, and productivity loss.  
This project aims to:
- Identify the **key indicators of employee attrition**  
- Predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company  
- Provide **data-driven insights** to HR teams for strategic retention

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Used datasets such as IBM HR Analytics & Kaggle HR Attrition data  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling null values, encoding categorical variables, balancing classes  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Studied attrition trends across age, salary, job role, and work-life balance  
4. **Model Building** – Implemented models like:
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
   - Random Forest  
   - Gaussian Naïve Bayes  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics used  
6. **Feature Importance Analysis** – Found that key factors include:  
   - Monthly Income  
   - Overtime  
   - Distance from Home  
   - Age and Job Role  

---

### 📊 Results
- **Best Model:** Gaussian Naïve Bayes  
- **Recall Score:** 0.54  
- **Accuracy:** ~90% on test data  
- **Main Finding:** Attrition was most influenced by income, overtime, and distance from work.
